# EiffelEvents .NET SDK

**EiffelEvents .NET SDK** is a .NET implementation for Eiffel events and  Assisted publishing service, which acts as an intermediate between the event author (publisher) and the Message Broker (RabbitMQ for instance).

EiffelEvents .NET SDK features include:

- Implement Eiffel events vocabularies as described in [Eiffel protocol](https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel) 
- Validate events' schema regarding target eventâ€™s version.
- Sign and verify events' signatures.
- Serialization/deserialization of events.
- Provide  APIs for users to publish, subscribe, acknowledge, reject and unsubscribe for strongly-typed Eiffel events to RabbitMQ.

It consists of two packages:

1. **EiffelEvents.Net** for events' implementation, 
2. **EiffelEvents.RabbitMq.Client** for assisted publishing to RabbitMQ.
